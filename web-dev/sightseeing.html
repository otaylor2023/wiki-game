    <h1>Activities are better than Sightseeing</h1>
    <t>My least favorite activity on any trip is "sightseeing." I would much rather go somewhere and do something than
        travel for the sole purpose of looking at something. For that reason, this guide focuses on activities rather
        than sights, although I encourage you to enjoy the view as well!</t>
